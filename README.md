# Simple File Picker with Rust and Iced GUI

This project is a small experiment in trying out the `iced` crate for building
out GUIs using Rust. One common problem that I seem to be running into is the 
fact that it takes a very long time for things to compile. Almost, 19 seconds on 
an average. Not sure if this is because of creating an binary executable that 
is launching a GUI or not, but that has been a major pain-point.

In the future, I might not use this crate and stick with Tauri only for 
faster compile times of UI components and using React niceties :)
